This project follows **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** principles to ensure user data privacy and security. The key measures include:

### User Consent:
- Users must explicitly consent before data collection (e.g., account creation, storing images).
- Cookie banners or consent pop-ups (if applicable) to allow users to accept or reject non-essential tracking.

### Data Privacy & Security:
- User authentication ensures that only authorized users can access their data.
- Firebase Security Rules are implemented to prevent unauthorized access to stored articles and images.
- HTTPS encryption ensures secure communication between users and the database.

### User Rights:
- Users can request access, correction, or deletion of their personal data.
- Users can reset their passwords and manage their authentication details.

### Data Retention & Storage:
- Data is stored securely in **Firebase Firestore and Storage**.
- Only necessary data is collected, and users can delete their accounts upon request.

### Third-Party Compliance:
- Firebase is GDPR-compliant, and only GDPR-compliant third-party services are used.

For any **privacy-related requests**, users can contact the project administrator.
